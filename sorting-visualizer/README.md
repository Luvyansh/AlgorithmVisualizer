## Overview

Sorting Visualizer is an intuitive and visually engaging tool to help users understand the functioning of various sorting algorithms. The application provides real-time visualizations of sorting processes, allowing users to observe how algorithms like **Merge Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Heap Sort**, **Selection Sort**, and **Insertion Sort** organize data.

### Key Features:

- **Interactive Sorting Visualizer**: Watch various sorting algorithms at work with color-coded animations for better clarity.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Includes popular sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- **Customization**: Option to generate a new random array or choose an array of any size.
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for smooth performance and a modern user interface.

## Features

- **Live Sorting Animation**: View real-time sorting animations as the algorithms run.
- **Dynamic Array Generation**: Generate a new random array with customizable size and range.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Visualize multiple algorithms by simply clicking the corresponding button.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of sorting animations for a personalized experience.

## Technologies

This project is built with the following technologies:

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing application state.
- **CSS**: To style the user interface with modern, responsive designs.
- **JavaScript**: To implement the logic for sorting algorithms and animations.
- **HTML5**: Markup for structuring the web page.
- **Web APIs**: To manipulate DOM elements for animations.

## Setup Instructions

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.0 or later)
- [npm](https://npmjs.com) (v8.0 or later)

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the project in action.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following sorting algorithms are implemented and visualized in the project:

1. **Merge Sort**  
   A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into two halves, sorts them, and merges them back together.

2. **Quick Sort**  
   An efficient, divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element and partitions the array around it.

3. **Heap Sort**  
   A comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds a heap data structure and repeatedly extracts the maximum element.

4. **Selection Sort**  
   A simple comparison-based algorithm that selects the smallest element and swaps it with the current element in the array.

5. **Insertion Sort**  
   A simple algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time by comparing and inserting each element in the correct position.
